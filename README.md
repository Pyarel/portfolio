# portfolio

Hello there!!.

I created this portfolio website with the help of a tutorial from freeCodeCamp where you can view my career details and have a detailed look at my professional journey.

Go ahead and feel free to use my project to build your own portfolio site and add some of your own features!!.

This project was built using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.

Give it a try and run this project and let me know what you think!.

Attaching some snaps of how the website looks in the browser.
